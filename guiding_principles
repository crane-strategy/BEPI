Adaptive: Systems and processes can manage regional policy differences; and adopt future innovations and improvements;
Repeatable: Process and ballot counting can run smoothly at all levels (local, state, and federal);
Collaborative: Consensus building through communication and participation;
Quick: Ballots can be counted quickly;
Immutable: Ballots cannot be changed or manipulated;
Safe: People counting ballots should feel safe and free from intimidation, so work can be performed accurately.
