The STAARCQIS ("Star-Kiss") Model is a set of guiding principles to modernize local, state, and federal election policies and systems.

**Secure**: Ballots cannot be leaked, thrown out, falsified, or cast multiple times;

**Transparent**: Monitor ballot flow, count ballots faster, identify errors, and fix errors quickly;

**Accessible**: Eligible voters have equitable access to exercise voting rights in accordance with State and U.S. Constitutions;

**Adaptive**: Systems and processes can manage regional policy differences; adopt future innovations and improvements;

**Repeatable**: Process and ballot counting can run smoothly at all levels (local, state, and federal);

**Collaborative**: Consensus building through communication and participation;

**Quick**: Ballots can be counted quickly;

**Immutable**: Ballots cannot be changed or manipulated;

**Safe**: People counting ballots should feel safe and free from intimidation, so work can be performed accurately.


What is/are the problem(s):

Lack of consistency in County election policies/procedures and State constitutions was used to dispute local and national elections.

The dispute of the U.S. Presidential election in U.S. Congress showcased critical vulnerabilities in the national election process. This included the potential for elected officials to overturn the outcome of the votes in a U.S. Presidential election.

There is fundamental error in process if elected officials challenging election results are able to overturn the outcome of an election.



How will we solve the problem:

By promoting consensus on the guiding principles needed to modernize local, state, and federal election policy.



Why is it needed?

U.S. Election policy needs modernization to address the "2020 U.S. Election Problem." 

Consensus at local, state, and national levels will be needed to change policies.



In more detail, what was the "2020 U.S. Election Problem?"

In the Nov. 3rd, 2020 Pennsylvania federal and state General Assembly election, two counties in a single house district counted mail-in ballots differently (counting of dated and un-dated ballots).

State Senate President Pro Tem of Pennsylvania refused to swear in a re-elected state house member.

Results certified by PA Secretary of State, challenged in PA Supreme Court, but upheld in federal court.

Re-elected house member was not sworn in until Jan. 13th, 2021 after their opponent dropped the suit.

Members of U.S. Congress voted to overturn PA’s presidential electoral college (EC) votes based on disagreement of the outcome. The majority of U.S. Congress voted to accept the PA’s EC vote, so PA’s EC votes were not overturned.

A violent insurrection on the U.S. Capitol was incited with the goal to intimidate lawmakers to invalidate PA’s EC votes and/or have Vice President Mike Pence overturn the national election results. No results were overturned.
