(2) Digitally verify voters easily in-person and online
(3) Voters and ballot counters should feel safe and free from intimidation

The STAARQIS ("Star-Kiss") Model is a set of bipartisan guiding principles to modernize local, state, and federal election policies. 

**Safe**: People voting and people counting ballots should feel safe and free from intimidation;

**Transparent**: Monitor ballot flow, count ballots faster, identify errors, and fix errors quickly;

**Accessible**: Eligible voters have equitable access to exercise voting rights in accordance with State and U.S. Constitutions;

**Adaptive**: Systems and processes can manage regional policy differences; adopt future innovations and improvements;

**Repeatable**: Process and ballot counting can run smoothly at all levels (local, state, and federal);

**Quick**: Ballots can be counted quickly;

**Immutable**: Ballots cannot be changed or manipulated;

**Secure**: Ballots cannot be leaked, thrown out, modified, falsified, sold to third parties, cast multiple times, or reveal personal information;

#The problem we seek to address

What is the problem?

Lack of consistency in County election policies/procedures and State constitutions was used to dispute local and national elections.

The dispute of the U.S. Presidential election in U.S. Congress showcased critical vulnerabilities in the national election process. This included the potential for elected officials to overturn the outcome of the votes in a U.S. Presidential election.

There is fundamental error in process if elected officials challenging election results are able to overturn the outcome of an election.



How will we solve the problem:

By promoting bipartisan consensus on the guiding principles needed to modernize local, state, and federal election policy.



Why is it needed?

This project began in February 2021 in response to the need for bipartisan consensus at local, state, and national levels to modernize U.S. Election policy and address the "2020 U.S. Election Problem." 


In more detail, what was the "2020 U.S. Election Problem?"

In the Nov. 3rd, 2020 Pennsylvania federal and state General Assembly election, two counties in a single house district counted mail-in ballots differently (counting of dated and un-dated ballots).

State Senate President Pro Tem of Pennsylvania refused to swear in a re-elected state house member.

Results certified by PA Secretary of State, challenged in PA Supreme Court, but upheld in federal court.

Re-elected house member was not sworn in until Jan. 13th, 2021 after their opponent dropped the suit.

Members of U.S. Congress voted to overturn PA’s presidential electoral college (EC) votes based on disagreement of the outcome. The majority of U.S. Congress voted to accept the PA’s EC vote, so PA’s EC votes were not overturned.

A violent insurrection on the U.S. Capitol was incited with the goal to intimidate lawmakers to invalidate PA’s EC votes and/or have Vice President Mike Pence overturn the national election results. No results were overturned.
